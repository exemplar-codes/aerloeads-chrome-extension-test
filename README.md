#### Task
Create a basic chrome plugin that pulls data from LinkedIn. For example, if I am on [linkedin.com/in/jason-smith-31242](http://linkedin.com/in/jason-smith-31242) profile, I should be able to pull his first name, last name and company and save it somewhere (no need to save too, just show it on browser console that you can do it)

Ideally, we want to do 2 with 1 so the data from the plugin gets sent to the app and get saved.
